The final assignment for the [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) program [Creative Programming for Digital Media & Mobile Apps](https://www.coursera.org/course/digitalmedia).

It is a minimal [Monome](http://monome.org/)-like musical loop device.

To use:
-	Click any empty space on the interface to create a key.
-	Click on any key to remove it.
-	Drag after either to continue adding/removing keys.
-	The pattern will loop automatically.

Caveat: The Processing.js audio plugin used in this sketch, Maxim (equivalent to Minim; ported and so wittily named by the instructors), only works in Webkit browsers.
